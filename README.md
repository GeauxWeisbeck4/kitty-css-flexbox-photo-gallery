# Kitty CSS Flexbox Photo Gallery

I created this project following the FreeCodeCamp.org CSS Flexbox course. I recently had to take a quite a long break from coding due to my current living situation, so I am going back through some old basics to refresh some of that old knowledge.

One thing that I found is that CSS can go fairly quickly if you are not practicing it often. Same with JavaScript, but I am trying to get my feel back for CSS and it is slowly coming back. 

This course allowed me to use the `display`, `flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` CSS properties to to create a cool layout with some very cute kitties. 

## Get Started

If you want to add to this code or anything, the easiest way is to use the StackBlitz Browser editor:

You can also fork the project, clone it, cd into it, and run `npm install && npm start` if you so desire.

Have fun!
